This dashboard allows you to view voter turnout in Chicago during the 2016 general election by voting precinct.

Other demographic and precinct-level variables are included for comparison, which should give the viewer a better understanding of demographic stucture of Chicago.

To view, download the chi_voter_dashboard.py file and the shapefiles directory to the same location on your computer. In a terminal window (on Mac), navigate to where you've saved the files and run "python chi_voter_dashboard.py" to access the dashboard, which will run locally, typically at "http://127.0.0.1:8050/"

The following python libraries are required for viewing:
- dash
- plotly
- geopandas
- shapely
